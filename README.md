## Coin Chaos
A NSMB2 rom hack.



#Tutorial
Welcome, today I will tell you how to load Coin Chaos on your Nintendo :3ds:
First of all, make sure you have the latest release of Luma3DS installed.
Then you need to boot your :3ds: while holding SELECT.(edited)
If you have Luma3DS installed, check where it says "Enable game patching."
Click START.
After your :3ds: boots, turn it off.(edited)
Remove the :sdcard: from the :3ds: and put it in your computer.
Open the SD directory on the computer.
Open "luma."
Inside the folder, make a folder called "titles."
Open "titles."
If you are in the USA, make a folder inside "titles" called "000400000007AE00."
If you are in Europe, make a folder inside "titles" called "000400000007AF00."
Now open the new folder you made, and make a folder called "romfs."
Now download everything in the "romfsdir" folder on the :drive:.(edited)
Don't put the "romfsdir" folder in "romfs," but everything in it.
Once that is done, reinsert the SD Card into your Nintendo :3ds:.
Load up your copy of NSMB2.
Enjoy Coin Chaos!
